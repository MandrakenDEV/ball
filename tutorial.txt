Welcome to the tutorial of the installation of Python 3.10 and pygame game "ball" (NOTE: This is NOT my code, I am uploading it to GitHub.com to help users make games with this code. Original code is in https://www.wikihow.com/Program-a-Game-in-Python-with-Pygame) 

1. Go to the directory python-installation and run 'python-installation.exe'
2. After the installation, go to CMD or PowerShell and run the command pip install pygame and that's it!
3. Now open ball.py and play!
